# Color Detection

This project is designed to detect and identify colors in images using Python and OpenCV. It allows users to click on any part of an image and receive the name and RGB values of the color at that point.

## Overview

The project performs the following tasks:
1. **Image Loading**: Loads an image from the specified path.
2. **Color Detection**: Identifies the color at the coordinates where the user clicks.
3. **Display**: Shows the image with the detected color name and RGB values displayed.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main script that runs the color detection application.
- `util.py`: Contains utility functions used in the project.
- `data/colors.csv`: A CSV file containing color names and their corresponding RGB values.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
